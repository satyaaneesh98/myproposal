                        <h3>Why are you so special to me?</h3>
                        <p class="muted">
                            You are special because you give meaning to life itself. Your presence brings joy, peace,
                            and a sense of completeness to me. Whenever you are around, I feel fulfilled, energized, and
                            smiling without even realizing it—just by seeing you.
                            There is a deep inner feeling in me to care for you, make you laugh, take you out, and be
                            with you every second. To me, you are not just a normal person—you are truly built
                            different.
                            I believe you are special because you have one of the purest hearts on this earth. You carry
                            no ego or jealousy. You treat everyone with respect and care for them like family. You
                            consider others’ problems as your own and always step forward to help anyone in need. You
                            are supportive, caring, and selfless.
                            You treat me differently from everyone else. You show attitude with me, you get angry
                            quickly—but you calm down just as fast. That one angry look from you is enough to make me
                            silent, and yet I still cherish it. I love listening to your talks every single day.
                            You are special because you are a rare blend of qualities—education, intelligence,
                            responsibility, management skills, care, concern, love, ethics, faith, and creativity. You
                            dance, you sketch, you pray, and you live with values. When you are hurt, you never seek
                            revenge. Instead, you handle everything in a calm, wise, and mature way. Your heart is
                            incredibly beautiful.
                            The spark I feel when you are around me is beyond words. I only dreamt of someone like you
                            in my dreams, but God showed me that dreams can walk on this earth—in the form of you. You
                            are deeply respected and loved by your family and friends, and that speaks volumes about who
                            you are

                            You give value not only to me, but also to my family and your own. You make thoughtful
                            decisions, and your maturity and understanding are truly exceptional. I feel our vibes,
                            values, and choices align perfectly. Our expectations from a partner are the same—to love
                            each other forever, make each other happy, travel the world, live a simple life filled with
                            beautiful memories, build a home, and share dreams together.
                            I truly believe you would care for my parents just as you care for your own. I see us
                            standing by each other during both highs and lows, sharing responsibilities, exploring the
                            world together, learning, and growing every day. Our mindsets are similar, and I feel
                            completely comfortable and understood with you. We adjust to each other effortlessly, like
                            no one else can.
                            We’ve already faced tough days together.
                            We supported each other during workdays.
                            We dedicated songs to one another.
                            We hummed them, felt them, and lived them.
                            You stayed awake with me during long drives.
                            When I was busy, you prepared everything.
                            You guided me—what’s right, what’s wrong, how to behave, how to present myself.
                            You treat me like a partner, like family, like home.
                            We roasted each other a lot.
                            We are two most loved humans by our families.
                            We are a perfect pair, anyone who sees us together used to say - you guys are so cute
                            together & each other. From the way we treat each other and everything. We act like enemies,
                            best friends, love of life.
